Intuitively, we can consider this phenomenon as each neuron becoming more capable because it knows it cannot depend on its neighbors. Also, because it forces information to be stored in a redundant way. During testing there is no dropout, so we are now using all our highly tuned neurons. In short, it is generally a good approach to test how a net performs when a dropout function is adopted.\n","\n","Besides that, note that training accuracy should still be above test accuracy, otherwise, we might be not training for long enough.
